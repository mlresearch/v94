abstract: Gradient boosting relies on linearly combining diverse and weak hypotheses
  to build a strong classifier. In the class imbalance setting, boosting algorithms
  often require many hypotheses which tend to be more complex and may increase the
  risk of overfitting.  We propose in this paper to address this issue by adapting
  the gradient boosting framework to a non-linear setting. In order to learn the idiosyncrasies
  of the target concept and prevent the algorithm from being biased toward the majority
  class, we suggest to jointly learn different combinations of the same set of very
  weak classifiers and expand the expressiveness of the final model by leveraging
  their non-linear complementarity. We perform an extensive experimental study using
  decision trees and show that, while requiring much less weak learners with a lower
  complexity (fewer splits per tree), our model outperforms standard linear gradient
  boosting.
