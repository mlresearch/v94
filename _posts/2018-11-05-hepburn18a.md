abstract: We study the design of cost-sensitive learning algorithms with example-dependent
  costs, when cost matrices for each example are given both during training and test.
  The approach is based on the empirical risk minimization framework, where we replace
  the standard loss function by a combination of surrogate losses belonging to the
  family of proper losses. The actual contribution of each example to the risk is
  then given by a loss that depends on the cost matrix for the specific example. We
  then evaluate the use of such example-dependent loss functions in real-world binary
  and multiclass problems, namely credit risk assessment and musical genre classification.
  Using different neural network architectures, we show that with the appropriate
  choice of the example-dependent losses, we can outperform conventional cost-sensitive
  methods in terms of total cost, making a more efficient use of cost information
  during training and test as compared to existing discriminative approaches.
