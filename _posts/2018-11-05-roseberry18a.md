abstract: Multi-label data streams is a highly challenging task involving drifts in
  features and labels. Classifiers must automatically adapt to changes while keeping
  a competitive accuracy in a real-time dynamic environment where the frequencies
  of the labelsets are non-stationary and highly imbalanced. This paper presents a
  multi-label k Nearest Neighbor (kNN) with Self Adjusting Memory (SAM) for drifting
  data streams (ML-SAM-kNN). It exploits short- and long-term memories to predict
  the current and evolving states of the data stream. The experimental study compares
  the proposal with eight other multi-label classifiers for data streams on 23 datasets
  on six multi-label metrics, evaluation time, and memory consumption. Non-parametric
  statistical analysis of the results shows the superiority of ML-SAM-kNN, including
  when compared with ML-kNN.
