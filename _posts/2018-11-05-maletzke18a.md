abstract: Early approaches to detect concept drifts in data streams without actual
  class labels aim at minimizing external labeling costs. However, their functionality
  is dubious when presented with changes in the proportion of the classes over time,
  as such methods keep reporting concept drifts that would not damage the performance
  of the current classification model. In this paper, we present an approach that
  can detect changes in the distribution of the features that is insensitive to changes
  in the distribution of the classes. The method also provides an estimate of the
  current class ratio and use it to adapt the threshold of a classification model
  trained with a balanced data. We show that the classification performance achieved
  by such a modified classifier is greater than that of a classifier trained with
  the same class distribution as the current imbalanced data.
