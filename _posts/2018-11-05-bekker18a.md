abstract: For many interesting tasks, such as medical diagnosis and web page classification,
  a learner only has access to some positively labeled examples and many unlabeled
  examples. Learning from this type of data requires making assumptions about the
  true distribution of the classes and/or the mechanism that was used to select the
  positive examples to be labeled. The commonly made assumptions, separability of
  the classes and positive examples being selected completely at random, are very
  strong. This paper proposes a weaker assumption that assumes the positive examples
  to be selected at random, conditioned on some of the attributes. To learn under
  this assumption, an EM method is proposed. Experiments show that our method is not
  only very capable of learning under this assumption, but it also outperforms the
  state of the art for learning under the selected completely at random assumption.
