abstract: The problem of imbalanced domains is important in multiple real world applications.
  This problem has been thoroughly studied for classification tasks. In particular,
  the adaptation of ensembles to tackle imbalanced domains has shown important advantages
  in a classification context. Still, for imbalanced regression problems only a few
  solutions exist. Moreover, the capabilities of ensembles for dealing with imbalanced
  regression tasks is yet to be explored. In this paper we present the REsampled BAGGing
  (REBAGG) algorithm, a bagging-based ensemble method that incorporates data pre-processing
  strategies for addressing imbalanced domains in regression tasks. The extensive
  experimental evaluation conducted shows the advantage of our proposal in a diverse
  set of domains and learning algorithms.
