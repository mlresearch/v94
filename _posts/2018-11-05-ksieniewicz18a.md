abstract: Following work tries to utilize an ensemble approach to solve a problem
  of highly imbalanced data classification. Paper contains a proposition of umce –
  a multiple classifier system, based on k-fold division of the majority class to
  create a pool of classifiers breaking one imbalanced problem into many balanced
  ones while ensuring the presence of all available samples in the training procedure.
  Algorithm, with five proposed fusers and a pruning method based on the statistical
  dependencies of the classifiers response on the testing set, was evaluated on the
  basis of the computer experiments carried out on the benchmark datasets and two
  different base classifiers.
