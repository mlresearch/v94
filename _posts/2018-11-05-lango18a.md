abstract: Preprocessing methods for imbalanced data transform the training data to
  a form more suitable for learning classifiers. Most of these methods either focus
  on local relationships between single training examples or analyze the global characteristics
  of the data, such as the class imbalance ratio in the dataset. However, they do
  not sufficiently exploit the combination of both these views. In this paper, we
  put forward a new data preprocessing method called ImWeights, which weights training
  examples according to their local difficulty (safety) and the vicinity of larger
  minority clusters (gravity). Experiments with real-world datasets show that ImWeights
  is on par with local and global preprocessing methods, while being the least memory
  intensive. The introduced notion of minority cluster gravity opens new lines of
  research for specialized preprocessing methods and classifier modifications for
  imbalanced data.
